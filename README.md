Hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is an aggressive liver cancer with poor prognosis and high incidence. This project investigates the role of hub genes in LIHC progression and their potential as therapeutic targets using gene expression data from TCGA-LIHC, GTEx, and GEO (GSE54236). A total of 68 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, enriched in pathways such as complement activation, cytokineâ€“cytokine receptor interaction, O-glycosylation, and cellular metabolism. Notably, disruption of the lectin complement pathway and downregulation of related genes may impair immune response and promote tumor growth and metastasis. These findings highlight key molecular pathways that could enhance diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and the development of targeted therapies for LIHC.
